# TS + VSCode Import/Export

Test drive the import/export space of TS and VSCode workflow support.

```
VSCode version = 1.38.0
TypeScript version = 3.6.3
```

### Cases

#### Import of generic identifier

##### Result

Multiple auto-import hints. User can differentiate by going over each option and seeing the `from` differences. Does not import qualified. As a user, working with generic names intended to work by namespace, this is probable not what you want. Namespaced auto-import is an [open issue on TS repo](#namespaced-auto-import).

##### Example

image::assets/generic-autoimport-hint2.png[]
image::assets/generic-autoimport-result.png[]

> What the user probably actually wanted. Namespaced auto-import is an [open issue on TS repo](#namespaced-auto-import)

#### Import from module with both named & default exports

##### Result

As expected.

##### Example

image::assets/import-from-named-default-module.png[]
image::assets/import-from-named-default-module-result.png[]

#### Identifier in both named & default export position

##### Result

VSCode presents two auto-complete hints. Selecting either produces same result: Import of the default export. Default export seems to shadow named one. Two hint given suggets VSCode is aware of the duality, but fumbles thereafter.

Slightly buggy. Presumably non-issue in near future. OK if named import is not common case.
